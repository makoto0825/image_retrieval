The mechanism of Image_retrieval operates as follows: First, the characteristic features of the search target are obtained in advance and stored in a database. When a user performs a search using a query image, the features of the query image are also extracted. Then, the extracted features of the query image is compared with the features stored in the database for each image, and the images with high similarity are ranked. Finally, the top-ranked images are presented to the user.In this project, I used the fashion items' datasets.
